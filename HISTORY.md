Feature/replicator db object
 --- 2015-01-07T21:34:34Z: Got rid of stray print statement.
 --- 2015-01-07T19:00:15Z: Added test_replication_state. This seemed to push the number of tests over a threshold, and I'm consistently seeing replication docs hang out and not get updated -- I'm pushing so that others can take a look.
 --- 2015-01-07T13:43:07Z: Added a Replicator object, which is basically a wrapper around a Database object.

Added some methods to account and database to faciliate automagic in piecing together the replication.

Added 'creds' property to Database objects, and used it in replications.

Added a .delete method to Document, which supports a .stop_replication method to the Replicator object.
