Contributor License Agreement
=============================

In order for us to accept pull-requests, the contributor must first complete
a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). This clarifies the intellectual
property license granted with any contribution. It is for your protection as a
Contributor as well as the protection of IBM and its customers; it does not
change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

This is a quick process: one option is signing using Preview on a Mac,
then sending a copy to us via email.

You can download the CLAs here:

- `Individual <http://cloudant.github.io/cloudant-sync-eap/cla/cla-individual.pdf>`_
- `Corporate <http://cloudant.github.io/cloudant-sync-eap/cla/cla-corporate.pdf>`_

If you are an IBMer, please contact us directly as the contribution process is
slightly different.
