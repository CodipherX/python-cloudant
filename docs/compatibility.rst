Compatibility
=============

This library can be used with the following databases

* `IBM Cloudant® Database-as-a-Service <https://cloudant.com/>`_
* `IBM Cloudant® Data Layer Local Edition (Cloudant Local) <http://www.ibm.com/software/products/cloudant-data-layer-local-edition>`_
* `Apache CouchDB™ <http://couchdb.apache.org/>`_

Note that some features are Cloudant specific.

The library is developed using `Python™ 2.7.10 <https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2710/>`_ and should be 2.x compatible.  It is currently not 3.x compatible.  We have plans to add that in the future.
